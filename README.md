# AI_Learning_Video
Creates a video showing the AI learning a visual image. The video "output.mp4" is an example of a realtime video of an AI learning the example image "face.png".

**Example Video (Not Real-time):**

**How To Use**
* in AI_Learning.py, set the image file, and other option variables to what ever you want
* Then set the hyper parameters to what ever you want
* Then Run, and see the output video!

**Notes:**
* The realtime videos may have very High FPS, and some video players might slow them down to 60FPS which makes them non-realtime, so make sure to use a good video player
* When training the AI on different images you may need to tweak the Hyper parameters and the number of hidden layers
* Depending on the Size of the image and the hyper parameters you choose, you might want to run this on a GPU
* Finally, this is a project I made for fun. Obviously the Model could be improved massively using newer techniques like stable diffustion, and this is not how a typpical AI would be used. A normal AI that is developed is typically used to generalize information, not memorize like this model is. But again, thats the point, its just for fun :)
